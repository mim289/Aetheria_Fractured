## Geographical Information

Weaveward is one of the smallest of the "main" islands, but it is the most rich in the Weave. Surrounded by a magical aura, it imbues those there with an enhanced connection to the Weave, allowing them to study it quicker.  A few pockets of tree glades dot the landscape, but the vast majority of it's surface (as well as part of it's core) is dominated by the [[The Institute of Mystical Studies]].
