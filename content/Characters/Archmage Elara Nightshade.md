## Personality

Elara is a highly intelligent and skilled wizard, but she is also a kind and compassionate teacher. She is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the protection of the Weave. However, she can be quite stern and demanding when necessary, and she has a sharp wit that can cut through even the toughest of arguments. She also has a soft spot for making a few shiny gold pieces, in the form of "donations" to the Institute via [[The Nexus]]

## History

- Previously a member of [[Breakers of Mist]]
- Has leveraged her centuries of magical study to create [[The Nexus]]
- Has been instrumental in brokering peace between [[Ironheart]] and 

## Current Role

She currently serves as the Headmaster for [[The Institute of Mystical Studies]], the worlds foremost college for study on the Weave. She accepted the role after her time with the [[Breakers of Mist]] concluded, and was a very easy choice for the role. She's seen as a hero, one of the few who has come back from [[Mistveil]] in one piece. She's also an alumni of the college herself, and under her guidance, she has grown it 10-fold.

She also president of the board for [[The Nexus]], as she was instrumental in not only the design of the network and magic surrounding it, but also brokering deals with the large islands to allow for connections between them.
