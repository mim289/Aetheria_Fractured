Created originally on [[Ironheart]], these vessels are now mass-produced to traverse the skies. Large enough to comfortable fit 100+ people, these are the main transport for people who cant afford the "small" donation the Nexus requires for each use.

Additionally, these are the only means of travel between the smaller island. They also serve as the only means to be able to access [[Mistveil]], the largest island in the world of Aetheria. 

Originally designed during the [[The Race to Descent]], they failed in their original purpose. See that event for more information.
