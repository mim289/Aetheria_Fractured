## Founding

The Institute was originally founded a millennia ago by a powerful wizard Orion. He was the first to discover the powerful connection to the Weave on the island, and was able to quickly enroll several Wizards under his tutelage. 

For a very long time, the Institute served only Wizards in their pursuit of the arcane, as Orion thought that only those who studied hard enough would benefit from the teachings there. When Orion retired, [[Archmage Elara Nightshade]] was elected to be the next Headmaster. 

When she took up the mantle, she expanded the purview of the Institute to cover all magics that connect with the Weave. The studies of the divine were viewed as to precious to those who serve in [[Celestial Crest]]
