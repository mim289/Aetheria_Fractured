# Welcome to the world of Aetheria!

This realm is one made up of large floating islands in the sky. They are varied and diverse, due to the large period of time before the Nexus was created. There are hundreds of small islands speckling the sky, most too small to have too much of note. 

The larger ones, though, are all united via the Nexus; a weave-based portal network created by [[Archmage Elara Nightshade]]. For a small "donation" of a few gold pieces, citizens are able to traverse these portals, quickly jumping from Island to Island. The main exception to this is the island of [[Mistveil]], the largest of the island world, but one shrouded in a magical suppressing fog. 

For islands unable to be linked via the Nexus, or too small or unremarkable, the use of [[Airships]] is common.
